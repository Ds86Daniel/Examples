This is a Python script that automates the deployment of a Flask web application and a MySQL database to a Kubernetes cluster. The script defines a `DIRECTORY` variable that specifies the directory where the files will be saved and deployed from. The `run_command` function executes a system command and returns its output. The `write_file` function is a helper function that writes content to a file in the `DIRECTORY`.

The script generates a Dockerfile for the Flask app, which specifies a Python 3.8-slim base image, installs the required packages, and runs the Flask app. The Flask app code connects to a MySQL database and returns a JSON response with a message from the database. The script also generates a `requirements.txt` file that specifies the required Python packages for the Flask app.

The script generates Kubernetes configuration files for deploying MySQL and the Flask app. The MySQL deployment YAML file specifies a service and a deployment with a MySQL 5.7 image, a root password, and a test database. The Flask app deployment YAML file specifies a service and a deployment with two replicas, a custom image built from the Dockerfile, and a load balancer service.

The script changes to the `DIRECTORY` and builds the Docker image using the Dockerfile. Then, it deploys the MySQL configuration to Kubernetes using the `kubectl apply` command. Finally, it deploys the Flask app configuration to Kubernetes using the same command. The script prints the output of each command and a message indicating that the deployment is complete.

Overall, this script provides a useful automation tool for deploying a Flask app and a MySQL database to a Kubernetes cluster. However, the script could benefit from some improvements in terms of error handling and security. For example, the `run_command` function could be modified to raise an exception if the command returns a non-zero exit code. Additionally, the script could use environment variables instead of hardcoding sensitive information.
