This folder contains a simple DevSecOps program containing: SHA-256 algorithms, AES encryption and encryption, simple malware detection for any given file using 'fake' generated hash to represent malware. (hash generated for demonstration only)
NOTE* The malware detector does not have a link to a malware dataset and uses a dummy generated one instead. Therefore, it is not a functional malware detector. It is for demonstration purposes only.
